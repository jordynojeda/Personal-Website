    title: "About Me"
    image: "/images/website_photo.jpeg"
    content: |-
      I hold both a Bachelor's and a Master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Minnesota, with a focus on AI/ML and Software Engineering during my graduate studies. As part of my master's program, I worked as a research assistant in a computational neuroscience lab, where I developed machine learning models that laid the groundwork for my thesis project. 
      
      Currently, I’m a Data Scientist at Polaris, where I focus on feature engineering, developing ML models, and working with generative AI applications. In addition, I continue to collaborate with my research lab on an exciting project in partnership with MedARC.
      
      What sets me apart is my strong communication, leadership, and mentorship skills. During my internship at Trane Technologies, I had the opportunity to lead and mentor software engineering interns, honing my ability to guide teams and drive results. I’m also an active member of Toastmasters at Polaris, where I continually refine my public speaking and communication skills, an essential part of effectively conveying complex ideas and leading teams.

      - title: Brain-optimized inference improves reconstructions of fMRI brain activity
        content: Recent advances in AI and large datasets have significantly improved image reconstruction from brain activity. We introduce a brain-optimized inference method that iteratively refines initial reconstructions using an encoding model to maximize alignment with neural activity. By sampling and selecting images that best match brain responses, our method enhances reconstruction quality beyond state-of-the-art approaches, as validated by human ratings, feature metrics, and neural alignment. Notably, refinement rates vary across visual cortex, with early visual areas converging more slowly. This approach improves reconstruction accuracy and provides insights into brain representation dynamics.

      - title: Reconstructing seen images from human brain activity via guided stochastic search
        content: Visual reconstruction maps brain activity to pixels, traditionally relying on brute-force search through large image libraries. We enhance this process using generative diffusion models, decoding semantic descriptors from fMRI data and iteratively refining image samples based on encoding model predictions. This guided search preserves semantic content while improving low-level details across iterations, producing high-quality reconstructions. Additionally, variation in convergence times across visual cortex suggests a novel way to study representational diversity in different brain regions.

        image: /images/publication_2.png
      - title: Second Sight - Using brain-optimized encoding models to align image distributions with human brain activity
        content: Image reconstruction from brain activity has advanced with large datasets and powerful generative models, yet most methods aim for single best-image estimates. We propose Second Sight, an iterative refinement approach that optimizes an image distribution for alignment with brain activity. By selectively refining both semantic and low-level features, our method produces reconstructions that rival state-of-the-art techniques. Interestingly, convergence times vary across visual cortex, with early areas preferring narrower distributions. This approach offers a novel way to explore how different brain regions represent visual information.
